        <p>
          <br />
          Our Passes website (&ldquo;Website&rdquo;) uses various cookies which
          allow us to distinguish you from other users of our Website, which
          helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our
          Website and also allows us to improve our Website.
          <br /> <br />
          We use cookies to provide the content and functionality of our Website
          (strictly necessary cookies) and, with your permission, to personalize
          the content that appears when you visit our Website and to analyze the
          traffic on the Website. In addition, we may share information about
          your use of our Website with our advertising partners and analysts,
          who may combine this information with other data that you provide to
          them or that they have collected when you use their services. You have
          the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
          <br /> <br />
          You do not need to allow cookies to visit most of the Website.
          However, enabling cookies may allow for a more tailored browsing
          experience and is required for certain parts of the Website to work.
          In the majority of cases, a cookie does not provide us with any of
          your personal information.
          <br /> <br />
          For further information about this cookie policy, please contact us at
          help@passes.com.
          <br /> <br />
          You can change the cookie settings that will be placed when you visit
          our Website by changing the settings in your cookie preferences.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="font-bold">2. What are cookies?</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Cookies are small data files containing a unique identifier that are
          placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.
          Cookies and similar technologies enable operators or websites to
          recognize your device and collect information from it when you
          interact with them and serve different purposes, like helping us
          understand how our Website is being used, letting you navigate between
          pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally
          improving your browsing experiences.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="font-bold">3. Key Concepts</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <u>First-party cookies</u> are those set by a website that is being
          visited by the user at the time (e.g. cookies placed by
          www.passes.com.)
          <br /> <br />
          <u>Third-party cookies</u> are cookies that are set by a domain other
          than that of the website being visited by the user. If a user visits a
          website and another entity sets a cookie through that website, this
          would be a third-party cookie.
          <br /> <br />
          <u>Persistent cookies</u> are cookies that remain on a user&ldquo;s
          device for the period of time specified in the cookie. They are
          activated each time that the user visits the website that created that
          particular cookie.
          <br /> <br />
          <u>Session cookies</u> these cookies allow website operators to link
          the actions of a user during a browser session. A browser session
          starts when a user opens the browser window and finishes when they
          close the browser window. Session cookies are created temporarily.
          Once you close the browser, all session cookies are deleted.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="font-bold">4. Changing your cookie settings</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          You can change your cookie preferences when you visit our Website by
          changing the settings in your cookie preferences. You can also block
          cookies by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to
          refuse the setting of all or some cookies. However, if you use your
          browser settings to block all cookies (including strictly necessary
          cookies), you may not be able to access all or parts of our Website.
          <br /> <br />
          Please note that internet browsers allow you to change your cookie
          settings. These settings are usually found in the
          &ldquo;options&rdquo; or &ldquo;preferences&rdquo; menu of your
          internet browser. In order to understand these settings, the following
          links may be helpful. Otherwise you should use the &ldquo;Help&rdquo;
          option in your internet browser for more details:
