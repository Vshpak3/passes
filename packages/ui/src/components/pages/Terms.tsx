          PASSES PLATFORM TERMS OF SERVICE <br /> Last Updated Date: November
          11, 2022 <br /> <br /> Welcome, and thank you for your interest in
          Passes (“Passes”, “we” or “us”), our website at www.passes.com and
          associated mobile applications (“Website”), and any other services or
          resources that are accessed or enabled via the Website (collectively
          with the Website, the “Services”). <br />
          <br /> PLEASE READ THESE PLATFORM TERMS OF SERVICE (“TERMS OF
          SERVICE”) CAREFULLY. While we’ve taken all effort to explain the
          provision of our Services to you in as simple and straightforward a
          manner as possible, there will inevitably be clauses that do contain a
          little bit of ‘legalease’. If you require any further explanation or
          clarification with regards to any of the following, please feel free
          to get in touch with us and we would be more than happy to provide
          further explanation and assistance. <br />

          READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF SERVICE; (2)

          agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information

          with applicable law, regulation, or policy, including laws related to
          money laundering and funds obtained by criminal means, or for
          counteracting financing of terrorism, or otherwise in Passes’ sole
          discretion. Passes may also require you to provide additional

          the requirements of applicable law, regulation, or policy. If you do
          not provide complete and accurate information and documents in
          response to any such request from Passes, Passes may refuse to provide
          any NFTs, product, service, and/or further access to the Services to

          warrant to us as follows: Independent Investigation and Non-Reliance.
          You are sophisticated, experienced and knowledgeable in the minting,
          listing, buying, selling or trading of any NFTs (as defined below)
          using blockchain technology. Additionally, you have conducted an
          independent investigation of the Services and the matters contemplated
          by these Terms of Service, have formed your own independent judgment
          regarding the benefits and risks of and necessary and desirable
          practices regarding the foregoing and, in making the determination to
          mint, list, buy, sell or trade any NFTs using the Services, you have
          relied solely on the results of such investigation and such
          independent judgment. You understand, acknowledge and agree that the
          legal requirements applicable to blockchain technologies and digital
          assets generally, including the NFTs, are evolving, and you have
          conducted an independent investigation of such potentially applicable
          legal requirements and the resulting risks and uncertainties,
          including the risk that one or more governmental entities or other
          persons may assert that any digital assets or cryptographic tokens
          (including the NFTs) may constitute securities under applicable legal
          requirements. Litigation. There is no legal proceeding pending that
          relates to your activities relating to the minting of NFTs or other
          token or digital asset trading or blockchain technology related
          activities. Compliance. You have not failed to comply with, and have
          not violated, any applicable legal requirement relating to any
          blockchain technologies, token trading activities or minting NFTs. No
          investigation or review by any governmental entity is pending or, to
          your knowledge, has been threatened against or with respect to you,
          nor does any government order or action prohibit you or any of your
          representatives from engaging in or continuing any conduct, activity
          or practice relating to buying, minting or selling NFTs. Your Account.
          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, you acknowledge and
          agree that you shall have no ownership or other property interest in
          your Account. Necessary Equipment and Software. You must provide all
          equipment and software necessary to connect to the Services. You are
          solely responsible for any fees, including Internet connection or
          mobile fees, that you incur when accessing or using the Services.
          Relationship of the Parties. You are an independent contractor and not
          a partner, joint venturer, agent or employee of Passes, and you will
          not bind or attempt to bind Passes to any contract. Neither these
          Terms of Service nor your use of the Services shall create an
          association, partnership, joint venture, or relationship of principal
          and agent, master and servant, or employer and employee, between you
          and Passes. <br />
          <br />
          USING THE SERVICES. Platform. The Services include a platform (the
          “Platform”) where Passes, Members and Creators can sell and buy
          tangible and/or digital goods, assets, products, services, and
          benefits (“Benefits”), including, but not limited to, non-fungible
          tokens hosted on a blockchain platform (“NFTs”). Pricing and payment
          terms, including the specific details with relation to the offering of
          any NFTs, shall be set forth at the point of sale. Certain portions of
          the Platform may be accessible only through the Membership Community
          of a particular Creator. NFTs and Benefits listed on the Platform are
          being offered by the individuals seeking to sell NFTs and Benefits
          (“Sellers”), and the actual contracts for sale are between the Sellers
          and the individuals seeking to buy NFTs and/or Benefits (as
          applicable) (“Buyers”). While we may, in our discretion, help
          facilitate resolution of disputes through various programs, we have no
          control over the quality of NFTs offered on the Platform nor the
          Benefits offered by the Sellers. We cannot control or guarantee the
          truth or accuracy of a Member’s or Creator’s Content, the ability of
          the Creator to deliver the Benefits, the ability of Sellers to sell
          NFTs, the ability of Buyers to pay for NFTs, or that a Buyer and
          Seller will actually complete a transaction or deliver or return any
          NFTs listed on the Platform or deliver any of the Benefits they offer.
          While Passes may provide pricing and guidance for NFTs sold by Sellers
          on our Platform, such information is solely informational. We do not
          have control over the quality, timing, legality, failure to provide,
          or any aspect whatsoever of any reviews provided by Members, NFTs sold
          by Sellers, Benefits offered or sold by the Creators or of the
          integrity, responsibility, or any actions of any Members. Passes makes
          no representations about the suitability, reliability, timeliness or
          accuracy in public, private or offline interactions. When interacting
          with other Members you should exercise caution and common sense to
          protect your personal safety and property, just as you would when
          interacting offline with other persons whom you don’t know. PASSES IS
          NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY
          USER OF THE SERVICES. PASSES WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, INJURY
          OR DAMAGE ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER
          USERS OF THE SERVICES OR YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE ANY NFTs
          PURCHASED THROUGH THE SERVICES. Purchasing NFTs through the Platform.
          You may from time to time have the opportunity to purchase NFTs
          through the Platform. NFTs may be redeemed for or used to ‘unlock’
          various goods, rights, and other privileges on or through the
          Services, including, but not limited to, unique Creator Content not
          otherwise available to Members. The terms applicable to the purchase
          of each NFT will be displayed to you at the point of sale, and such
          terms will be viewable at all times thereafter by the then-current
          owner of the relevant NFT. When you purchase a NFT through the
          Platform, you agree to comply with any terms, including licenses or
          payment rights, that are embedded within or otherwise included with
          such NFT, and to make commercially reasonable efforts to bind
          subsequent owners of such NFTs to any such terms. Unless otherwise
          expressly set forth at the point of sale for such NFT, ownership of a
          NFT does not convey any right, title or interest in or to the Content,
          including any characters, artwork, or other work of authorship,
          embodied by or linked to such NFT (such Content, “NFT IP”). Unless
          otherwise expressly set forth at the point of sale for such NFT, when
          you purchase a NFT you shall receive in connection with such NFT a
          limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable license to
          view and display the NFT IP for your personal, non-commercial use and
          to perform, display and reproduce the NFT IP solely in accordance with
          the functionality of the Services for so long as you own such NFT.
          Storage of Your NFTs. Passes will record ownership of your NFTs on its
          internal ledger. You will be able to access your NFTs through your
          Account. If you lose your Account, you may lose access to your NFTs.
          While your NFTs may be interoperable with other compatible
          blockchains, platforms, digital wallets or other services, only NFTs
          supported by Passes that are stored on the Platform will be accessible
          through the Platform. NFTs that have been transferred out of your
          Account to a third-party blockchain, platform, digital wallet or other
          service may no longer be compatible with the Platform, and Passes
          disclaims all liability in connection with NFTs that have been so
          transferred. Memberships. Members may from time to time be given
          access to Membership Communities through the Platform. Each Membership
          Community has unique access requirements. Members may be able to use
          certain NFTs to gain access to a Membership Community. Once you join a
          Membership Community, you may have access to certain Creator Content
          and/or Third-Party Websites and/or Third-Party Applications (as
          defined below) through such Membership Community. Selling NFTs through
          the Platform. PLEASE READ CAREFULLY THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT
          PROCEDURES FOR SELLING NFTs THROUGH THE PLATFORM BEFORE USING THE
          PLATFORM TO SELL NFTs. To help the government fight the funding of
          terrorism and money laundering activities, applicable law requires all
          financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that
          identifies each person who has an account which has the ability to
          list items for sale on the Platform. When you engage in transactions
          on the Platform, we may ask for your name, address, date of birth, and
          other information that will allow us and/or our Payment Processor(s)
          (as defined below) to identify you. We may also ask for a copy of your
          driver’s license or other identifying documents. We reserve the right
          to require you to provide additional information and documents in
          accordance with Section 4.3 of these Terms of Service. Failure to
          provide such information upon request, as well as any other violation
          of these Terms of Service, may result in your removal from the
          Services, including a termination of your ability to sell through the
          Platform. Restrictions Specific to NFTs. You shall not (and shall not
          permit any third-party to) take any action or Make Available any
          Content on or through the Services that engages in or knowingly
          facilitates any ‘front-running’, ‘wash trading’, ‘pump and dump
          trading’, ‘ramping’, ‘cornering’ or fraudulent, deceptive or
          manipulative trading activities, including: (a) trading a NFT at
          successively lower or higher prices for the purpose of creating or
          inducing a false, misleading or artificial appearance of activity in
          such NFT, unduly or improperly influencing the market price for such
          NFT trading on the Services or establishing a price which does not
          reflect the true state of the market in such NFT; (b) executing or
          causing the execution of any transaction in a NFT which involves no
          material change in the beneficial ownership thereof; (c) entering any
          order for the purchase or sale of a NFT with the knowledge that an
          order of substantially the same size, and at substantially the same
          price, for the sale of such NFT, has been or will be entered by or for
          the same or different parties; or (d) participating in, facilitating,
          assisting or knowingly transacting with any pool, syndicate or joint
          account organized for the purpose of unfairly or deceptively
          influencing the market price of an a NFT. Taxes on Transactions
          Involving NFTs. You are solely responsible for determining what, if
          any, taxes apply to transactions involving your NFTs. Neither Passes
          nor any other Passes entity is responsible for determining the taxes
          that may apply to transactions involving NFTs. Access Cards. Passes
          offers two types of access card: (a) Subscription cards; and (b) Super
          Cards (each as defined below, and each a “Card”). Each of these Cards
          allows you to enjoy access to exclusive Content and/or Membership
          Communities, as described at the point of sale. You can purchase a
          Card through the Services. By purchasing a Card, you authorize us to
          charge the relevant fees to the payment method with which you placed
          the order. Subscription Cards. You can choose to purchase a
          subscription to access, view, and interact with exclusive Content
          and/or Membership Communities and/or enjoy other benefits (each a
          “Subscription”). Subscriptions will automatically be renewed at the
          end of the relevant subscription period at the then-current
          subscription fee, except if your payment method payment is declined or
          if you have cancelled your Subscription. You have the right to cancel
          your Subscription at any time, and if you do so you will be permitted
          to enjoy the benefits attached to the Subscription until the end of
          your subscription period in which you cancelled, after which no
          further payments will be taken from your payment method in respect of
          the Subscription (unless you choose to renew your Subscription at a
          later stage) and you will no longer be able to continue to enjoy the
          benefits attached to the Subscription. Super Cards. You can choose to
          purchase a Super Card to access, view, and interact with exclusive
          Content and/or Membership Communities and/or enjoy other real life
          benefits. When you purchase a Super Card, you will continue to enjoy
          the benefits attached to it until the expiration date specified by the
          Creator selling the Super Card and specified at the point of sale.
          Account Management. Certain Creators may use third party companies,
          agencies or individuals to manage their account for them (including
          but not limited to the posting of content and answering of messages
          sent to the account), meaning that when interacting with a Creator you
          may be interacting with a third party company, agency or individual.
          Passes is not responsible for your interaction with, or the management
          of, a Creator account, nor is Passes responsible for ensuring your
          interactions are with the Creator themselves. PASSES WILL NOT BE
          LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, INJURY OR DAMAGE ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR
          INTERACTIONS WITH A CRETOR OR A THIRD PARTY MANAGEMENT COMPANY, AGENCY
          OR INDIVIDUAL MANAGING THE CREATOR’S ACCOUNT ON THEIR BEHALF.
          <br />
          <br />
          RESPONSIBILITY FOR CONTENT. Types of Content. You acknowledge that all
          Content shall be the sole responsibility of the party from whom such
          Content originated. This means that you, and not Passes, are entirely
          responsible for all Content that you upload, post, sell, e-mail,
          transmit or otherwise make available (“Make Available”) through the
          Services (“Your Content”), and that other Members of the Services, and
          not Passes, are similarly responsible for all Content that they Make
          Available through the Services (“User Content”). User Content
          includes, but is not limited to, Creator Content. No Obligation to
          Pre-Screen Content. You acknowledge that we have no obligation to
          pre-screen Content (including, but not limited to, User Content),
          although we reserve the right in our sole discretion to monitor,
          pre-screen, refuse or remove any Content. By entering into these Terms
          of Service, you hereby provide your irrevocable consent to such
          monitoring. You acknowledge and agree that you have no expectation of
          privacy concerning the transmission of Your Content, including, but
          not limited to, chat, text, or voice communications. In the event that
          Passes pre-screens, refuses or removes any Content, you acknowledge
          that Passes will do so for Passes’ benefit, not yours. Without
          limiting the foregoing, we shall have the right to remove any Content
          that violates these Terms of Service or that we otherwise determine in
          our sole discretion is objectionable. Storage. Unless expressly agreed
          to by us in writing elsewhere, we have no obligation to store any of
          Your Content that you Make Available on the Services. Passes has no
          responsibility or liability for: (a) the deletion or accuracy of any
          Content, including Your Content; (b) the failure to store, transmit or
          receive transmission of Content; or (c) the security, privacy,
          storage, or transmission of other communications originating with or
          involving use of the Services. Certain Services may enable you to
          specify the level at which such Services restrict access to Your
          Content. You are solely responsible for applying the appropriate level
          of access to Your Content. If you do not choose, the system may
          default to its most permissive setting. You agree that we retain the
          right to create reasonable limits on our use and storage of the
          Content, including Your Content, such as limits on file size, storage
          space, processing capacity, and similar limits as determined by us in
          our sole discretion. <br />
          <br />
          OWNERSHIP. Services. Except with respect to Your Content and User
          Content, you agree that Passes and our licensors own all rights, title
          and interest in and to the Services (including but not limited to, any
          computer code, themes, objects, characters, character names, stories,
          dialogue, concepts, artwork, animations, sounds, musical compositions,
          audiovisual effects, methods of operation, documentation and Passes
          software). Trademarks. Passes and all related graphics, logos, service
          marks and trade names used on or in connection with the Services are
          the trademarks of Passes and may not be used without permission in
          connection with your, or any third-party, products or services. Other
          trademarks, service marks and trade names that may appear on or in the
          Services are the property of their respective owners. Your Content.
          Passes does not claim ownership of Your Content. However, when you
          post or publish Your Content on, in or through the Services, you
          warrant that you own and/or have a royalty-free, perpetual,
          irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive right and license to use,
          display, share, and monetize Your Content worldwide on, in or through
          the Services. License to Your Content. Subject to any applicable
          account settings that you select, you grant Passes a fully paid,
          royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-exclusive and fully sublicensable right and license to use,
          license, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publicly perform, and
          publicly display Your Content for the purposes of operating and
          providing the Services to you and to our other Members and to improve
          the Services and develop new products and services. Please remember
          that other Members may search for, see, use, modify and reproduce any
          of Your Content that you submit to any ‘public’ area of the Services.
          You agree that you, not Passes, are responsible for all of Your
          Content that you Make Available on or in the Services. User Content.
          You may only use any User Content, whether as embedded in or otherwise
          comprising a NFT or otherwise available on the Services, in accordance
          with the terms of these Terms of Service and with the terms of any
          additional right or license granted expressly by the creator of such
          User Content and, in the case of NFTs, as set forth at the point of
          sale and solely if as applicable to you as a Buyer. Username.
          Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, by
          submitting Your Content to any ‘public’ area of the Services, you
          hereby expressly permit us to identify you by your username (which may
          be a pseudonym) as the contributor of Your Content. Feedback. You
          agree that submission of any ideas, suggestions, documents, and/or
          proposals to Passes through our suggestion, feedback, wiki, forum or
          similar pages (“Feedback”) is at your own risk and that we have no
          obligations (including, but not limited to, obligations of
          confidentiality) with respect to such Feedback. You warrant that you
          have all rights necessary to submit the Feedback. You hereby grant to
          Passes a fully paid, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide,
          non-exclusive, and fully sublicensable right and license to use and
          commercially or non-commercially exploit in any manner any and all
          Feedback. <br />
          <br />
          INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER USERS. User Responsibility. You are solely
          responsible for your interactions with other Members and any other
          parties with whom you interact; provided, however, that we reserve the
          right, but have no obligation, to intercede in such disputes. You
          agree that Passes will not be responsible for any liability incurred
          as the result of such interactions. Content Provided by Other Users.
          The Services may contain User Content provided by other Members.
          Passes is not responsible for and does not control User Content.
          Passes has no obligation to review or monitor, and does not approve,
          endorse or make any representations or warranties with respect to,
          User Content. You use all User Content and interact with other Members
          at your own risk. <br />
          <br />
          FEES AND PURCHASE TERMS. Fees. Registering for the Services is free;
          however, we charge certain fees for various transactions through your
          use of the Services (“Fees”) as set forth at the point of sale. All
          amounts are quoted in US dollars unless otherwise stated. Payment. You
          agree to pay any Fees or charges incurred by your Account in
          accordance with the fees, charges and billing terms then-currently in
          effect. You may be required to provide us or our Payment Processor(s)
          (as defined below) with a valid credit card, digital wallet address,
          bank account information or other payment provider account (“Payment
          Method”) as a condition to accessing certain Services. By providing us
          with your Payment Method details, you agree that Passes is authorized
          to immediately invoice your Account for all fees and charges due and
          payable to us hereunder and that no additional notice or consent is
          required. We reserve the right at any time to change our fees, prices,
          and/or billing methods, either immediately upon posting on the
          Services or by e-mail delivery to you. Taxes. Any payments required
          may not include any Sales Tax that may be due in connection with the
          Services provided. If Passes determines it has a legal obligation to
          collect a Sales Tax from you, Passes will collect such Sales Tax in
          addition to the other payments required. If any Services or products,
          or payments for any Services or products, are subject to any Sales Tax
          in any jurisdiction and you have not paid the applicable Sales Tax to
          Passes, you will be responsible for the payment of such Sales Tax and
          any related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority, and
          you will indemnify Passes for any liability or expense Passes may
          incur in connection with such Sales Taxes. For purposes of this
          section, “Sales Tax” means any sales or use tax and any other tax
          measured by sales proceeds that is the functional equivalent of a
          sales tax where the applicable taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise
          impose a sales or use tax. <br />
          <br />
          ASSUMPTION OF RISK RELATED TO BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY. You acknowledge
          and agree that: The prices of digital assets are extremely volatile.
          Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and
          adversely affect the value of NFTs, which may also be subject to
          significant price volatility. We cannot and do not guarantee that any
          purchasers of NFTs will not lose money. NFTs exist and can be
          transferred only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the
          blockchain supporting such NFTs. Any transfer of NFTs occurs within
          the supporting blockchain. Passes makes no warranties about the
          quality or availability of any supporting blockchain. There are risks
          associated with using NFTs and cryptocurrency, including, but not
          limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections,
          the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third
          parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within
          your Account (including your NFTs). The legal and regulatory regime
          governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies and tokens is
          uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely
          affect the development of the Services and the value and/or utility of
          NFTs. There are risks associated with purchasing user-generated User
          Content, including but not limited to, the risk of purchasing
          counterfeit assets, mislabeled assets, assets that are vulnerable to
          metadata decay, assets on smart contracts with bugs and assets that
          may become untransferable. Passes has no responsibility for any
          counterfeit assets that mimic Passes assets. Passes reserves the right
          to hide NFTs that Passes suspects or believes may violate these Terms
          of Service. NFTs you purchase may become inaccessible on the Services.
          Under no circumstances shall the inability to view any assets on the
          Services serve as grounds for a claim against Passes. Passes has no
          responsibility for the NFTs sold, bought or traded on the Services.
          Passes does not investigate and cannot guarantee or warrant the
          authenticity, originality, uniqueness, marketability, legality or
          value of any NFT created or traded on the Services. For the avoidance
          of doubt, Passes shall have no responsibility for any failure of any
          Member or Creator to comply with any terms regarding the authenticity,
          originality, uniqueness, scarcity or other description or
          characteristics of the NFT furnished by or on behalf of that Member or
          Creator and available via the Services. <br />
          <br />
          RELEASE. Passes expressly disclaims any liability that may arise
          between users of its Services. The Platform is only a venue for
          connecting Buyers with Sellers. Because Passes is not a party to the
          actual contracts between Buyers and Sellers, in the event that you
          have a dispute with one or more users, you release Passes, its
          parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, employees, investors,
          agents, partners and licensors, but excluding any users (each a
          “Passes Party” and collectively the “Passes Parties”) from any and all
          claims, demands, or damages (actual or consequential) of every kind
          and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed
          and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such
          disputes. <br />
          <br />
          INDEMNIFICATION. You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Passes and
          the Passes Parties from any losses, costs, liabilities and expenses
          (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) relating to or arising out of
          any and all of the following: (a) Your Content; (b) your use of the
          Services in breach of these Terms of Service; (c) your violation of
          any rights of another party, including any Members; (d) your purchase
          or attempt to purchase NFTs on or through the Services; (e) your sale
          or attempt to sell NFTs on or through the Services; or (f) your
          violation of any applicable laws, rules or regulations. Passes
          reserves the right, at its own cost, to assume the exclusive defense
          and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you,
          in which event you will fully cooperate with Passes in asserting any
          available defenses. You agree that the provisions in this section will
          survive any termination of your Account, these Terms of Service and/or
          your access to the Services. <br />
          <br />
          DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS. AS IS. YOU EXPRESSLY
          UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
          APPLICABLE LAW, YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK, AND THE

          FAILURE OR DATA LOSS; (3) CORRUPTED DIGITAL WALLET OR NFT FILES; (4)
          UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO APPLICATIONS; OR (5) ANY UNAUTHORIZED
          THIRD-PARTY ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE USE OF
          VIRUSES, PHISHING, BRUTEFORCING OR OTHER MEANS OF ATTACK AGAINST THE
          SERVICE OR NFTs. PASSES MAKES NO WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION OR CONDITION
          THAT: (1) THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS; (2) YOUR USE OF
          THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE OR ERROR-FREE; OR
          (3) THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE
          ACCURATE OR RELIABLE. ANY CONTENT DOWNLOADED FROM OR OTHERWISE
          ACCESSED THROUGH THE SERVICES IS ACCESSED AT YOUR OWN RISK, AND YOU

          INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM AND ANY DEVICE YOU
          USE TO ACCESS THE SERVICES, OR ANY OTHER LOSS THAT RESULTS FROM
          ACCESSING SUCH CONTENT. THE SERVICES MAY BE SUBJECT TO DELAYS,
          CANCELLATIONS AND OTHER DISRUPTIONS. PASSES MAKES NO WARRANTY,
          REPRESENTATION OR CONDITION WITH RESPECT TO SERVICES, INCLUDING, BUT
          NOT LIMITED TO, THE QUALITY, EFFECTIVENESS, REPUTATION AND OTHER
          CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SERVICES. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER
          ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED FROM PASSES OR THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL
          CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY MADE HEREIN. FROM TIME TO TIME,
          PASSES MAY OFFER NEW ‘BETA’ FEATURES OR TOOLS WITH WHICH ITS USERS MAY
          EXPERIMENT. SUCH FEATURES OR TOOLS ARE OFFERED SOLELY FOR EXPERIMENTAL
          PURPOSES AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND MAY BE MODIFIED OR
          DISCONTINUED WITHOUT NOTICE AT PASSES’ SOLE DISCRETION. PASSES DOES

          TIMES, IN ALL LOCATIONS OR AT ANY GIVEN TIME, OR THAT PASSES WILL

          EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES.

          you may do so by: (a) notifying us at any time; and/or (b) closing
          your Account for all of the Services that you use, provided, however,

          with respect to any NFT or other digital asset obtained by you through
          the Platform. Termination by Passes. Passes reserves the right to
          terminate your access to some or all of the Services, including by

          Effect of Termination. Termination of any Services includes removal of
          access to such Services and barring of further use of the Services.
          Termination of all Services also includes deletion of your Account and
          all related information, files and Content associated with or inside
          your Account (or any part thereof), including Your Content. Upon
          termination of any Service, your right to use such Service will
          automatically terminate immediately. You understand that any
          termination of Services may involve deletion of Your Content

          liability whatsoever to you for any suspension or termination,
          including for deletion of Your Content. All provisions of these Terms
          of Service which by their nature should survive, shall survive

          access, the Services or any other Passes community, is discontinued by
          us due to your violation of any portion of these Terms of Service or
          for conduct otherwise inappropriate for the community, then you agree

          around the world and may contain references to Services and Content
          that are not available in your country. These references do not imply
          that Passes intends to announce such Services or Content in your
          country. The Services are controlled and offered by Passes from its
          facilities in the United States of America. Passes provides no
          warranties that the Services are appropriate or available for use in

          using the Payment Processor’s payment processing facility, you must
          provide accurate and complete information, and you authorize us to
          share this information with the Payment Processor and to charge your

          of Service. All bank, credit card or other payment information is sent
          directly to and stored with the Payment Processor using its security
          protocols. Passes does not store your payment information on its
          systems and shall not have any responsibility for the safety or
          security of that information. Third-Party Websites, Applications and

          (“Third-Party Websites”), applications (“Third-Party Applications”)
          and advertisements for third parties (“Third-Party Ads”). When you
          click on a link to a Third-Party Website, Third-Party Application or
          Third-Party Ad, we will not warn you that you have left the Services
          and are subject to the terms and conditions (including privacy
          policies) of another website or service. Such Third-Party Websites,

          pay you a percentage (%) of Passes’ Net Consideration in respect of
          the Sale (the “Sale Proceeds”). For the purpose of this Section, “Net
          Consideration” shall mean, with respect to any Sale, the total
          consideration actually received by Passes in connection with such Sale
          less any fees, taxes, and third-party expenses (e.g. any ‘gas’ or
          other payment or transaction processing fees). Payment Terms. When
          cashing out, you can either select to receive your funds via bank
          transfer or directly in a crypto wallet of your choice. The percentage
          taken by Passes for any Sales will depend on whether Sale is paid with
          credit/debit cards or cryptocurrencies. We take a 20% fee of all
          credit/debit Sales, and a 10% fee of all cryptocurrency Sales. Unless
          you opt otherwise, Passes shall pay Sale Proceeds owed to you
          bi-weekly within thirty (30) days of the end of each such bi-weekly
          period to your digital wallet address account or bank account as
          identified in your Creator Account. Withholding of payment. Passes may
          withhold all or any part of the Sale Proceeds due to you but not yet
          paid out if: (i) we reasonably believe that you have breached any part
          of these Creator Terms of Service or any part of the Platform Terms of
          Service; (ii) you attempt or threaten to breach any part of these
          Creator Terms of Service or any part of the Platform Terms of Service
          in a way which we reasonably believe could harm Passes or another
          Creator or Member; (iii) we reasonably suspect that all or any part of
          the Sale Proceeds result from unlawful or fraudulent activity, either
          by you or by the Buyer; (iv) we reasonably suspect that the relevant
          Creator Content infringes any third-party intellectual property; or
          (v) we have received complaints from our Members that you do not
          provide the Subscription Benefits associated with the Access purchased
          by the Buyer, for as long as is necessary for us to investigate the
          actual, threatened or suspected breach by you or the suspected
          unlawful activity (as applicable). We shall not have any
          responsibility to you if we withhold any of your Sale Proceeds where
          we have a right to do so under these Creator Terms of Service.
